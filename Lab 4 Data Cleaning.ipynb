    "    In this lab, I will first be choosing the two datasets I want to clean upon completing a full exploration of the data. Ultimately I chose to clean the attendance data and the Boing Boing Candy Data, because I think these datasets would be particularly fascinating to explore. \n",
    "    For the Attendance Data, I want to get rid of all my null values, reset the header to format it correctly and get rid of any information I do not need. This way I can have correctly formatted and compelete numerical data with no gaps. If I were to analyze this Attendance data I would want to find mean values for each of the states in correspondence to the features. To achieve this I would need to have cleaned and complete data for each of the 50 States, The District of Columbia, and The United States as a whole to set a benchmark. \n",
    "    For the Boing Boing Candy Data, I would want to get rid of all my null values and all of the answers from people who submitted null values because I want each candy type represented fairly. This is ultimately because if I were to analyze the Boing Boing Candy Data, I would want to compare consumer opinions of the candies to see which is people's favorite, if one candy had more total votes than others, it would skew the data towards that candy because it would recieve greater representation. I would additionally want to get rid of any features that are not real types of candies (that includes deleting any fake types of candies), and rename any duplicates in addition to simplifying all of the features."

    "Looking at our data set we see it is perfectly clean! We left a few non-numerical values inside the dataset because ultimately these serve to tell a story, one where just by looking at the dataframe you can make assumptions or predictions about certain privileges or restrictions in certain states or areas. Ultimately this is another part of the data and one I believe is important to preserve. Later, if I were to be performing numerical analysis of secondary schools, I would want to replace those non-numerical values with a placeholder numerical value, or separate the columns and remove those states from consideration. But ultimately that is not my decision to make now."

    "   Originally I was under the impression that all three of the datasets were equally messy, just in different ways. I ultimately chose the datasets I felt were most interesting and decided to clean those. I think that they seemed really messy at first but as I actually started working on them I realized that we have the tools and knowledge to clean them, it just might be annoying. I think that data cleaning in general is not that difficult, it just takes a while and is not necessarily the most enjoyable of times. The most annoying part of the datacleaning process was the desire to analyze the data that just stayed with me for the entire lab process--I kept having to tell myself to not analyze because then I would stop cleaning. \n",

I took this dataset from something that was difficult to understand, and a dataset that few in my class wanted to clean given the confusing formatting, to something that looks like the datasets we started this class analyzing. It would be very easy to take this new cleaned dataset and perform stastical analysis on it using the tools I have learned in this class. "

Fortunately, however, I believe my final product is a very clean Boing Boing Candy dataset. My goal for this dataset was to have easily readable data on what people's reactions were to different types of candy--this new dataset shows these reactions very clearly and I  even deleted columns that did not have anything to do with my objective for the dataset. Ultimately it would not be difficult to find the candy with the most positive or negative reactions--a vast improvement over the uncleaned Boing Boing Candy Data."
